# Welcome to my profile! 👋

I'm currently an undergraduate studying **Computer Science & Engineering**.  
👉 My interests currently resolve around programming and programming languages, DevOps and distributed systems.  
👉 In the past years I've covered a lot of breadth of topics, feel free to have a look around in my repositories :)  

I used to maintain a list of programming languages and technologies I worked with. This list got very long (and to be honest, I'm not particularly proficient at most of them!) so instead I'll list a few significant to me:
- 🎩 **Scala** is my favourite programming language (I wish I had more applications for it!).
- ☕ **Java** is by far my strongest language.
- 🔢 **Haskell** is a language I wish I was better at.
- 🏗️ **TypeScript** is the language I probably use most frequently on a day-to-day basis.
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** is my go-to RDBMS.
